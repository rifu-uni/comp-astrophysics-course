    "1. Mathematical Foundation: Finite Difference Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical differentiation serves as the essential bridge between theoretical physics—often expressed as continuous differential equations—and the discrete datasets obtained through observations or high-performance simulations. In computational astrophysics, we approximate derivatives by constructing \"stencils\" that sample the function at discrete grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these formulas can be derived via Lagrange Interpolation (approximating the function with a polynomial that passes through specific data points), they are most commonly conceptualized using Taylor Series Expansions. By discretizing the domain into a constant grid spacing h (the interval between samples), we can define the following first-order derivative approximations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Name\tDiscrete Formula ($f'_i \\approx$)\tTruncation Error\\\n",
    "Forward Difference $(D_+)\t\\frac{f_{i+1} - f_i}{h}\tO(h)$\\\n",
    "Backward Difference $(D_-)\t\\frac{f_i - f_{i-1}}{h}\tO(h)$\\\n",
    "Centered Difference $(D_0)\t\\frac{f_{i+1} - f_{i-1}}{2h}\tO(h^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on Grid Spacing (h) and Symmetry: The parameter h represents the discretization step (e.g., $\\Delta t$, $\\Delta r$, or $\\Delta D$). Note that the Centered Difference achieves a higher order of accuracy ($O(h^2)$) than one-sided methods. This occurs because the symmetry of the centered stencil causes the $h^1$ error terms in the Taylor expansion to cancel out exactly, leaving the $h^2$ term as the leading order of error.\n",

    "\n",
    "Context: Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars. By analyzing the Doppler shift in their pulse arrival times, we can measure their line-of-sight velocity $v(t)$. In a binary system, the rate of change of this velocity provides the orbital acceleration, $a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt}$.\n",

    "Context: In stellar modeling, hydrostatic equilibrium is dictated by the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dr}$. When simulating the interior of a star, we often encounter a physical boundary at the surface. At the outermost data point of a model, we cannot use centered or forward differences because there is no physical data \"outside\" the star's boundary. This constraint necessitates the use of one-sided, multi-point stencils to maintain high accuracy.\n",

    "1. Theoretical Accuracy: Why is the Centered Difference method in Exercise 3 significantly more reliable than the Forward Difference used in Exercise 1? Reference the Taylor series truncation in your answer.\n",
    "2. Convergence and Step Size: If the step size $h$ in the stellar model (Exercise 2) were halved, by what factor would the truncation error decrease for this second-order ($p=2$) method? Use the $O(h^p)$ relationship to justify your answer.\n",
    "3. High-Fidelity Simulations: In simulations of galactic collisions or long-term planetary dynamics, \"Mixed Differences\" or \"Approximations with more points\" (such as the $O(h^4)$ coefficients $a_1=2/3$, $a_2=-1/12$ found in diferencias_compactas.pdf) are utilized.
